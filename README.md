Topic: Monitoring the water extents of the Po River flowing south of Cremona during Spring-Summer 2023 and comparison with the same period in 2022.

Tasks: 

1. To extract the water extents as accurately as possible by classifying the data or by using indexes applied to Sentinel-2 data.
2. To compute the total water surface extents statistics (histogram, mean, variance, max and min values) in the period of interest.
3. To provide a two pages report explaining the processing steps that have been implemented.

The files have been shared includes all of these three tasked. I have uploaded code file, Project Reprt and Projecct Presentationfor reference.

Introduction:

Remote sensing is the process of detecting and monitoring the physical characteristics of an area by measuring its reflected and emitted radiation at a distance (typically from satellite or aircraft).These files shows the method to calculate and compare water surface areas of the Po River south of Cremona during the Spring-Summer periods of 2022 and 2023 using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and Google Earth Engine (GEE).
