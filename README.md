Monitoring the Water Extents of the Po River South of Cremona during Spring-Summer 2023 and Comparison with the Same Period in 2022

Introduction:
Remote sensing is the process of detecting and monitoring the physical characteristics of an area by measuring its reflected and emitted radiation at a distance (typically from satellite or aircraft).These files shows the method to calculate and compare water surface areas of the Po River south of Cremona during the Spring-Summer periods of 2022 and 2023 using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and Google Earth Engine (GEE).
